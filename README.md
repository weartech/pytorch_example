# PyTorch Example
An example of a convolutional neural network that Jay worked on before

## Notes:
Will not work, I only included the notable files, thus it will not run properly.

Data preprocessing is an extremely important aspect not really touched upon in this example.

Comments explain each part of main.py and model.py
